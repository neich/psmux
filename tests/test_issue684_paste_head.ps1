# Issue #684 follow up: the FIRST character of a Ctrl+V burst must not go out
# as typing.
#
# gabri-ns, on Windows 10 19045 with a real Windows Terminal Ctrl+V into a
# recorder pane, on master and on the build before the #684 fix alike:
#
#   [paste] zero-latency flush 1 char(s) as typing
#   [send] -> send-text "M"
#   [paste] stage2: 71 chars in 20ms, waiting for Ctrl+V Release
#   [paste] paste CONFIRMED (post-event), sending 90 chars as send-paste
#   child:  M ESC[200~ icrosoft Windows [Version 10.0.19045.7725] ...
#
# The head of the paste was on the wrong side of the marker.  An earlier run
# with a 490 byte clipboard leaked 32 characters the same way.  The client's
# "zero-latency typing flush" assumed the console host injects a clipboard
# atomically, so paste_pend would already hold three or more characters by the
# time the event batch was drained; on his host the first batch held one.
#
# This box (26200) does inject atomically, so the 19045 shape is emulated with
# tests/paste_host_injector.cs `drip`: one WriteConsoleInputW per character,
# PSMUX_INJECT_GAP_MS apart (a spin, not Thread.Sleep, which would round up to
# the 15.6 ms tick).  Measured on the fix's parent, a 2 ms drip put ALL 43
# characters outside the brackets, one send-text at a time.
#
# tmux never has this problem: its host brackets the paste in the byte stream
# and tty_keys_paste (tty-keys.c:838) returns 1 for "partial" until the closing
# ESC[201~ arrives, so nothing of a paste is ever dispatched as keys.  The
# console input buffer carries no such marker, so the client recognises the
# head of a paste from the clipboard (a paste IS the clipboard) or from a
# Ctrl+V press still in flight.
#
# The third case is the control: a hand typing must still take the zero latency
# path, character by character, with no brackets and no hold.
